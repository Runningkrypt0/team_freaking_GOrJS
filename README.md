# team_freaking_GOrJS
My first foray into GO, as well as a TF2 VMF toolchain

The JS tool allows one to edit room borders and feature placements within a worldspace, then output these in csv format

The GO tool allows one to take in a csv produced and ouput a vmf ready to open in hammer for hand editing or compiling
